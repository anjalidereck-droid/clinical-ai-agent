# CRA App - Clinical Research Assistant

A user-friendly web application for analyzing clinical trial protocols using AI. Upload your protocol, get intelligent analysis, identify issues, and find specific information instantly.

---

## Project Overview

CRA App is an intelligent assistant designed to help clinical researchers, CRAs (Clinical Research Associates), and protocol reviewers analyze clinical trial protocols efficiently. The application uses AI-powered analysis to identify common discrepancies, missing sections, and quality issues in protocols.

## Features

Upload Protocol
- Drag and drop PDF file upload
- Automatic text extraction from PDFs
- Fast processing

Protocol Analysis
- Quality checks and issue detection
- Identify missing sections and endpoints
- Severity-based reporting (High, Medium, Low)

Interactive Search
- Search for specific information in protocols
- Find inclusion criteria, endpoints, adverse events
- Extract specific sections

Summary View
- Protocol completeness overview
- Check presence of key components
- Visual status indicators

User-Friendly Interface
- Tabbed interface for easy navigation
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
- No login or authentication required
- Local privacy - data stays on your machine

## How to Use

1. Upload Protocol
   - Click the upload area or drag and drop your PDF
   - Select a clinical trial protocol in PDF format

2. View Analysis
   - Protocol Summary tab shows which sections are present
   - Issues tab displays detected quality problems
   - Search tab allows searching for specific information

3. Get Recommendations
   - Each issue includes a recommended fix
   - Severity levels indicate priority

4. Search Protocol
   - Type keywords in the search box
   - Results show relevant text from the protocol

---

## Quality Checks Performed

The application checks for:

High Priority
- Missing or unclear primary endpoints
- Absent adverse event definitions
- Missing enrollment criteria

Medium Priority
- Undefined secondary endpoints
- Missing sample size specifications
- Incomplete statistical analysis plans

Low Priority
- Unclear study duration
- Missing follow-up period details
